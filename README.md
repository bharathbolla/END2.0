# Assignment-5 
The goal is to build a sentiment analysis model using StanfordSentimentAnalysis Dataset.

Use "Back Translate", "random_swap" and "random_delete" to augment the data you are training on
Download the StanfordSentimentAnalysis Dataset from this link (http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/stanfordSentimentTreebank.zip) Use "datasetSentences.txt" and "sentiment_labels.txt" files from the zip you just downloaded as your dataset. This dataset contains just over 10,000 pieces of Stanford data from HTML files of Rotten Tomatoes. The sentiments are rated between 1 and 25, where one is the most negative and 25 is the most positive.
Train your model and try and achieve 60%+ accuracy. Upload your colab file on git with the the training logs
